# Factors howto

* represent categorical data as levels
* ordered or unordered
* it is basically an integer vector with named variables (ie self describing)
* lm and glm treat them as very special

## Create factor
```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes","yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
x

```

### summarize factor
```{r}
table(x)

```

### Factor info
Don't really understand the benefit of this.

```{r}
unclass(x)           # get the underlying values
attr(x, "levels")    # get specific attributes of factor
```
