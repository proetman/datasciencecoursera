# Bar Plot

Looks like there are a bunch of graphics parameters that can be added to each graph, see http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/graphics/html/par.html

## Load Data to plot
```{r}

pollution <- read.csv('C:/work/R/datasciencecoursera/Course4_ExploreData/Week1/avgpm25.csv', colClasses = c('numeric','character','factor','numeric','numeric'))
head(pollution)

```

## Bar Plot

```{r}
barplot(table(pollution$region), col = "wheat", main="Number of counties in each region")
```

## Bar Plot from ggplot2

### Facets (or panels)

for facets= a ~ b
a determines columns
b determines rows

we do drv ~ .   so have a column of graphs

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
qplot(hwy, data=mpg, facets=drv ~ ., binwidth=2)
```
