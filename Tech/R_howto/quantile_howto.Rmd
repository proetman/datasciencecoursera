# quantile

We need to know the value of 'count' that splits the data into the top 1% and bottom 99% of packages based on total downloads. In statistics, this is called the 0.99, or 99%, sample quantile. 

In the below example, count is a continues var in a DF called pack_sum


```{r}
quantile(pack_sum$count, probs = 0.99)
```
